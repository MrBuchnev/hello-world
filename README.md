# hello-world
This is my first Git repository

Hi, my name is Andrey.

I've started learning how to code a few weeks ago and am quickly learning the basics of front-end and back-end.
Right now I'm trying to figure out how to work with GitHub and, more importantly, Git to learn React. 
I really want to start a carreer in web development, although at the moment it seems like I still have a really long way to go.
